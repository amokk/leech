# Filenames matching rules below will be downloaded from feeds you
# specified in food file. Matching is case-insensitive.
#
# NOTE: Put empty line at the end of file
#
# Rules are simple:
#
# yo ho ho would match any files containing "yo", "ho" and "ho" 
# in that order
#
# You might also match files using usual wildcards: * and ?
# For instance: yo h? ho
#
# If you need fine-graned control on matching - see $CONFIG_DIR/downloads
