# Filenames matching regular expressions below will be downloaded from
# feeds you specified in foods-file. Matching is case-insensitive.
#
# NOTE: Put empty line at the end of the file
#
# Usual way to match any string is .*
#
# Example 1: 
#  ubuntu.*amd64.*
# will match
#  ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso
#  ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64.iso
#
# Example 2: 
#  ubuntu.*desktop.*amd64.*
# will match
#  ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso
# but won't match
#  ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64.iso
#
# Anything which is not an alphabet or digits should be escaped with \
#
# Example: \[netbook\ remix\].*ubuntu.*iso
# But normally you should be fine with: .*netbook.*remix.*ubuntu.*iso
#
# You could also use `leech-match-test "<FILENAME>" "<EXPRESSION>"` to check
# if expression is matching filenames you want it to match.
